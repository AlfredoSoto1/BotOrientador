## Contributing
### How can you help?
* First remember that in order to push  to GitHub any finished and tested code you will need to
  create a branch. This is where __*your*__ new version/implementation will be. All branches must be done localy
  on your machine unless you want to back up your code in the cloud repository (which should be your way to go).

* Always do a Pull Request on GitHub before merging to master. This pull request will let us know when your _build_ is
  done and needs to be revised before merging.

* Be always aware of the Pull Request done, there comments will be done by others
  that checked and approved your code contribution.

* Do **NOT** push to Master.

* Test your code before doing a Pull Request. Write useful and clear information about your new code to facilitate
  others for testing and approving.
